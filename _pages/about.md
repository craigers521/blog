I'm a tech enthusiast thats always fiddling with something or other.  Whether its modding game consoles, building PCs, setting up home automation or trying to learn some new bit of code.  I like to dabble in `python` and `ansible`.  

I'm hoping this blog helps someone like the may other blogs (and stack overflow posts) that have helped nudge me in the right direction in years past.
